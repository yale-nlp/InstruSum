In this task, you will be provided with a news article, a specific summary requirement, and a list of summaries numbered as follows: 1. Summary 1, 2. Summary 2, and so on.

The summaries are crafted to meet a specific summary requirement. Note that there may be identical summaries within the list.

Your task is to evaluate and rank the summaries in ascending order of their overall quality concerning the summary requirement. First, you will explain your ranking, and then you will provide the ranking of each summary. The ranking should be a number between 1 and 5, where 1 is the best and 5 is the worst.

Note: In case of a tie, do not skip a rank. For example, if Summary 1 has ranking 1 and Summary 2 and 3 both have ranking 2, then Summary 4 should be assigned a ranking of 3, not 4.

Please refer to the example below for the format of your response.

Example Response:
Explanation: "Your explanation of the ranking."
Ranking: "The ranking, e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3, 4."
